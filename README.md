1.0 Introduction
```
The significant game changing contributions technology has imparted on the film industry over the years cannot be overstated. Now more than ever, with the rising influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in most industries including film, a tech company of Microsoft's caliber is presented with an opportunity to venture into this industry and have its long overdue impact.

```python
1.1 Why the Film Industry
```
The film industry is a global lucrative titan, projected to accumulate US$85.16bn in 2024. As forecasted by Statista, the industry is estimated to register a 5.4% annual growth rate in revenue, with a user penetration of 24.1% by 2029. Going by these projections, Microsoft's venture into this industry has a promise of being remunerative.

1.2 The Existing Gap in the Film Industry
```
With the continuous evolution of the film industry, a gap is created from within. For instance, the growing influence of streaming, especially in the post-pandemic world has had economic woes on the film industry. Despite the infamous Netflix currently registered on the list of the few profitable streaming platforms, Marvel, on the other hand is struggling to maintain its renowned prominence. This could be an effect of marketing, because marketing heavily relied on cinemas however the audience currently prefers to stream in the comfort of their homes.

This is a good example of an existing gap created by the evolution of the film industry through technology. So how then can Microsoft bridge this existing gap but still profit off its innovation?

Let's have a look at the data analysis, to find elements that Microsoft should prioritise when venturing into the industry.


```python
2.0 Microsoft-Films Business Analysis and Findings 
```
I conducted a business analysis of the film industry where I used a 9 year data set (2010-2018) in my analysis. Within the mentioned timeframe, the US registered on average, a total gross income of US$ 38,979,410,396 from the film industry. About 72.5% of this income was amassed from foreign gross while the remaining 27.5% aggregates from the domestic gross. 

I used a different data set containing movie indices alongside their ratings, total number of votes, the popular name associated with the movie and the number of times this name appeared on the data set in a different movie index. 

As a priority, I conducted an analysis to establish whether there existed a correlation between the number of votes casted against the movie ratings and the name count and vice versa. The reasoning behind my priority was that there were certain movie indices that had a rating of 10, with votes as low as 3. On the other hand, while the lead name could occur multiple times in different movie indices, the ratings and votes were significantly average. And in certain instances where the lead name only appeared once, the movie registered high votes and with decent ratings.

My analysis revealed a subpar correlation between the average ratings and the total votes. The name count had a poor correlation against the total votes cast and no influence whatsoever on the average ratings. 

Therefore, in this case, I focused on the average ratings and the total number of votes cast, as the core of my analysis.

```python
3.0 Recommendations
```
With the above analysis, it is of paramount importance to put factors that could contribute to the generation of a lucrative income from this venture. As it is, a very high benchmark is already established. 

As a recommendation, put into consideration the top voted movies of this analysis and engage the lead names to find out the specific factors that contributed to the successes of their movies and incorporate these links into your invention.

Additionally, given the foreign percentage gross from the average total income generated annually, Microsoft should prioritize meeting the needs of the audience outside the US.
