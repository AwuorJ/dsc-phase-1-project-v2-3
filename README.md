2.0 Microsoft-Films Business Analysis and Findings 
```
I conducted a business analysis of the Film industry where I used a 9 year data(2010-2018) in my analysis. Within the mentioned timeframe, the US registered on average a total gross income of US$ 38,979,410,396 from the film industry. About 72.5% of this income is amassed from foreign gross while the remaining 27.5% aggregates from the domestic gross. 

I used a different data set containing movie index alongside their ratings, total number of votes, the popular name associated with the movie and the number of times this name appeared on the data set in a different movie index. 

As a priority I tried to establish whether there existed a correlation between the number of votes casted against the movie ratings and the name count and vice versa. The resoning behind my priority was that there were certain movie indices that had a rating 0f 10, with votes as low as 3. On the other hand while the lead name could occur multiple times in different movie indices, the ratings and votes were significantly average. And in some instances the lead name only appeared once, with high votes and decent ratings.

My analysis revealed a subpar correlation between the average ratings and the total votes. The name count on the other hand the name count had no influence on the average rating and a poor correlation with the total votes cast.
